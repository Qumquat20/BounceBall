# BounceBall

Collection of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional simple simulations of a ball bouncing not taking into account air resistance and friction.

Using gravity and elapsed time to calculate vertical velocity, after a bounce, conserved energy is determined using a Coefficient of Restitution stored in 'corBall'.
It's not perfect but it's close enough.
