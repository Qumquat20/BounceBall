# BounceBall

Collection of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional simple simulations of a ball bouncing assuming negligibile air resistance and no friction.

Using gravity and time elapsed to calculate vertical velocity, after a bounce, energy conserved is determined using a Coefficient of Restitution stored in 'corBall'.
It's not perfect but it's close enough.
