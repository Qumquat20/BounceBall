# BounceBall

A simple mostly realistic single-dimension simulation of a ball bouncing with negligible air resistance, friction and no deformation of the ball.

Graivty is precise to a single decimal point at 9.8 and the velocity of the ball after a bounce is determined using a Coefficient of Restitution of 0.75 meant to emulate a tennis ball.
Without testing the bounce with a real tennis ball there's no way to know if it is exaclty accurate but it should be close enough.
